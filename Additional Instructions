Sun Jumper 0.0.5


This file will be used to give any information regarding
playing the game, whether it would be controls or
how the game elements work. This file will be updated
with each progress update with new information each time.

The Player: They are controlled with W, A, and D. The S
button will be given functionality in the future.
W is to jump, A is to go to the left, and D is to go to
the right. The player's sprite has a sword but it is
currently unknown whether they will remain to have
that sword.

The Enemy (No name given): They will attempt to block
you from progressing, and will copy your jumps at the
exact moment you make them. They will also follow you,
whether it would be from the left or right. If you get
hit by the enemy, you will respawn either at the original
spawn location, or at a checkpoint flag.

The Flag: Flags like this one will serve as checkpoints 
throughout the game, all one must do to unlock that 
checkpoint is to touch it. This will make it so whenever
you get hit by an enemy, you will always respawn at that 
checkpoint flag.
